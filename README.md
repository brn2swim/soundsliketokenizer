# soundsliketokenizer

SoundsLike provides two levels of phonetic matching (narrow and wide) and handles common nickname and diminutive groupings. 
There are many ways to spell similar sounding names.  By incorporating the tokens produced by the SoundsLike Tokenizer your searches will become "more intellegent" by finding more meaningful matches.  
Copy the SoundsLike.dll and supporting SoundsLike.xml document (for intellesense) to your projects BIN directory and add a Reference.
